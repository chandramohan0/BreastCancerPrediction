# BreastCancerPrediction

This repository contains a machine learning model to predict whether a patient has breast cancer based on various features such as radius, texture, perimeter, etc. The model is trained using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset and the Jupyter Notebook contains the code for training the model, making predictions and evaluating its performance.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

You need to have the following packages installed on your system:

* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Sklearn
* Seaborn

You can install them by running the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib sklearn seaborn
```

## Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/chandramohan0/BreastCancerPrediction.git
```

## Running the model

The model can be run using the Jupyter Notebook `BreastCancerPrediction.ipynb`. The code will load the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, train the model, make predictions and evaluate its performance.


## Built With
